High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a significant factor in the development of various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The recent pandemic has exacerbated the situation, straining healthcare systems and diverting resources away from chronic patients, including those with CVDs. As a result, the treatment and management of these patients have been hindered, leading to a rise in CVD-related deaths worldwide. Regular monitoring of blood pressure is essential in preventing CVDs, as early detection and ongoing surveillance allow for effective treatment and control of hypertension.
